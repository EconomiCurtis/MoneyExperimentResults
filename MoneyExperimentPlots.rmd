## Money Experiment Notes

![](figs/BlueTicketUse.pdf) 

Plot notes: 

- Vertical black bars separate sequences. 
- Blue line segments indicate spells this subject held a Blue ticket. 
- Colored scatter points indicate different types of possible trades are rejections. 
- By implication, no scatter point means one of two things: 
    + No trade was possible
    + Or if I had a Blue ticket, I didn't make an offer but the other trader did.


The mark down doc `DataNotes.md` describe the session data `MoneyExperimentsResults.csv`. 
The r script, `01_dataCleaning.R` cleans the data, and `BlueTicketTradingPlots.R` implements the plot. 
Also see the helper data frames `M.E.df.plotPrep` and `BlueTicketHolder_startstop` for insight into the steps taken.
